# Parking-lot-management-system-with-image-sensing
Helps shop managers owning a parking lot to manage vehicles efficiently and read the incoming vehicles using image sensing by choosing an image file to extract text. Fix the number of slots, rate per hour and slots will be automatically allotted to the incoming vehicles and you will be notified if the vehicles exceed the slot limit.
The module tesseract.js has been used in order to implement the image sensing part which basically allows you to choose a file with text and the text will be extracted automatically, (here, the license plate) and hence it makes it easier for the manager to give entry to the vehicles
The entry time of the vehicle will be noted automatically and hence when the vehicle leaves the parking lot, the bill will accordingly be generated by noting the exit time and making use of the rate fixed by the manager
